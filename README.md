# TowerDefense

Pittsburgh Technical Institute 2D color-map based gaming project based around traditional tower defense gameplay.
This was merely a school project, but it does implement [an interesting 2D raycasting algorithm](https://github.com/Ragora/TowerDefense/blob/master/TowerDefense/TowerDefense/CollisionManager.cs#L65-L128)
that is used to [generate paths for the AI to follow](https://github.com/Ragora/TowerDefense/blob/master/TowerDefense/TowerDefense/AIManager.cs#L51-L163)
allowing it to work with arbitrary map layouts.
